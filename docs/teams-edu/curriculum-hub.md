# Curriculum Hub

With the [Curriculum Hub](https://replit.com/curriculum), admins on Teams for Education accounts can access pre-built projects, lesson plans, instructions, and tests to import and utilize in their own teams. Curriculum Hub materials are designed to work as full units or as stand-alone projects.

Teams for Education admin users may access the Curriculum Hub from their sidebar or at [this link](https://replit.com/curriculum).

Users may preview the lesson plans and sequence for each curriculum unit. *Project code, instructions, and solutions are only visible to admins after curriculum has been imported into their own team.*

To import the full curriculum into a team, click on "Import into Teams for Education" and select the destination team. *Because the full curriculum unit will be imported, we recommend creating a curriculum-only team that you can use to view all project details and solutions, then deploy to your other teams selectively.*
