# Hosting web pages

Web pages written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be hosted on Replit. HTML/CSS/JS repls are given a unique URL that can be shared with your friends, family, peers, and clients.

After running a repl, your repl will be hosted at the URL provided in the `result` tab.

## URL Format

The repl will be hosted with the following URLs:
* `https://REPL-NAME--USERNAME.repl.co`
* `http://REPL-NAME.USERNAME.repl.co`

Where `REPL-NAME` is the name of the repl and `USERNAME` is the owner's username.

If you create a repl with a title that matches your username (i.e. repl.it/@username/username), it will be hosted at:
* `https://USERNAME.repl.co`

If an anonymous repl is created, the username used in the URL will be `five-nine`.

Note that if your username contains underscores `_`, they will be converted to dashes in the URL.

## Updating Websites

Changes made to your repl will not be reflected in the live version until the web project is re-run. Running a web repl will update its live version.

Note that a repl's public link will persist, even after the repl has been deleted. You can clear a repl of its server code before deleting it in order to prevent it from loading.

## Hosted Repl Example

Here's an example of a hosted webpage using p5.js. The live, full-screen version can be found [here](https://p5-demo--timmy_i_chen.repl.co).

## Custom Domains

Any hosted repl can be linked to a domain that you own. This includes both [static sites](#hosting-a-web-site) and [HTTP servers](/hosting/deploying-http-servers). To get started, you'll need a domain to link with your repl. 


### Use a Free Domain

If you don't already have a domain, follow along with [CoolcoderSJ](https://replit.com/@CoolCoderSJ)'s helpful [step-by-step tutorial](https://replit.com/talk/learn/Link-Domains-with-Replit/124838) that will help get you set up a free custom domain with your Repl.

### Use GoDaddy Domain

If you have a GoDaddy Domain you can follow along with [these steps here](https://ca.godaddy.com/help/forward-my-godaddy-domain-12123) on how to forward your Godaddy Domain to your Repl!


## Takedown Requests

You can unlink your domain at any time by clicking on the pencil icon and clicking `unlink.`
